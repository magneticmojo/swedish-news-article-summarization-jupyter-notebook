<B>EU concerned by rising oil prices</B>

The European Commission said Tuesday the recent surge in oil prices threatens growth in Europe and may well be a blow to Europe's already faltering efforts to impose reforms designed to make Europe a more dynamic economy in the years ahead.*

"The present very high oil prices are without doubt of concern to the European Union," EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebals told a news conference at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

He said the Commission was concerned rising fuel costs will impact adversely not only on the well-being of "EU citizens but also regarding their effect on economic growth," notably the ambitious goal to make the EU the world's most dynamic economy by 2010.

He called on EU governments to redouble efforts to achieve greater energy savings and step up the search for alternative sources of energ but acknowledged that will only have a limited effect.

"Although the priority must be to reduce demand and to shift toward alternative and cleaner sources of energy ... in both the short and medium term the world will need an increase in the supply of oil and gas and more refining capacity," Piebals said.

He called on EU governments to improve coordination of their oil supplies through the International Energy Agency.

Under EU law, all 25 members of the union must retain emergency oil reserves equivalent to 90 days normal consumption.

Piebals welcomed last Friday's decision by the IEA to release reserve stocks in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. 
But since not all EU nations belong to the IEA, he called for coordination of EU oil stocks.

Earlier, the Czech government said it was ready to release about 10,000 barrels of crude oil every day to eliminate possible market shortages and asked that the EU pressure the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase oil production.

However, this week, OPEC said its production surpasses demand, adding that will eventually bring down prices.

OPEC President Sheik Ahmed Fahd Al Sabah, who is also Kuwait's energy minister, said the oil group's output of 30.4 million barrels a day was more than the prevailing demand and this was helping to increase stocks of oil, which should eventually calm prices.

He blamed the most recent boost in oil prices on Hurricane Katrina, which has disrupted U.S. refineries along the Gulf of Mexico.

NYMEX oil prices dropped Tuesday as some calm returned to markets after the IEA nations released 60 million barrels of crude from strategic stockpiles last week to help the U.S. oil industry recover from Hurricane Katrina. 

However, Brent crude was up, and analysts said prices overall could rise again because the long-term effects of Katrina's damage are likely to make it difficult for refineries to meet the demand for gasoline and other products.

Light crude oil for October delivery was down 50 cents by midday in Europe to US$67.07 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was closed Monday for the U.S. Labor Day holiday. 
It closed Friday at US$67.57 a barrel.
