Foreign ministers debate the response to Ankara's refusal to recognise amember-state, as Turkey awaits the start of accession talks

EUROPEAN Union foreign ministers bickered over how pointed their response should be to Turkey's declaration that it refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus.
But that non-recognition is not likely to prevent Ankara from commencing scheduled EU accession talks on October 3.

The matter was expected to be resolved by the end of the September 1-2 informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Newport, Wales, which was also to be attended by Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul on the second day.

Gul defiantly rejected calls from the European Commission and many EU member-states that Turkey open its ports and airports to Cypriot vessels. 
"Ports and airports are in the services sector, and their opening is expected only of full EU members. 
This is different from what is expected of those conducting accession talks. 
Let nobody play politics with Turkey," he declared on September 1.

The issue highlighted existing tensions between France and the British EU presidency, as the two countries expressed very different views on how the union should respond to Turkey's stance towards Cyprus. 
While the British supported Ankara's refusal to recognise the Republic of Cyprus, the French underlined that recognition is a key condition for the normalisation of Turkey's relations with Cyprus. 
France also insisted that Turkey fully implement the extension of its customs union with the EU to Cyprus, including the opening of Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot vessels.

The disagreement over Turkey is widely viewed as an extension of the British-French dispute over the EU budget and British calls for a review of the Common Agricultural Policy, of which France has been a main beneficiary.

The Cypriot government reacted sharply to the initial British draft statement, accusing London of partiality. "Britain's stance is not satisfactory and did not exhibit the necessary impartiality and objectivity. 
On the contrary, the presidency made an effort to inject into the counter-declaration elements of Britain's own [national] policy," said Cypriot government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomidis on August 31.

Cyprus wanted EU foreign ministers to demand that Ankara revoke its statement refusing to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and insist that Turkey open its ports and airports to Cypriot vessels. 
Nicosia insists that recognition is an essential step on the path towards normalising Cyprus-Turkey relations, but stops short of demanding that this be done before October 3.

Chrysostomidis underlined that Cyprus would not approve the negotiating mandate for accession talks with Turkey, which must be approved by all 25 EU member-states before negotiations start, unless it is satisfied with the EU counter-declaration on Turkey's refusal to recognise Cyprus.
Such a move would effectively block the start of talks on October 3. 
"If the outcome of the counter-declaration is not satisfactory, then there can be no discussion or approval of the negotiating mandate and, consequently, that may mean that Turkey-EU negotiations cannot begin," Chrysostomidis said on September 1.

A Cypriot government source told the /Athens News/ that along with France, Denmark and Sweden supported Nicosia's demand for a sharper response to Turkey's refusal to recognise Cyprus. 
But Cyprus does not support calls from countries such as Austria, and the German Christian Democrats, for Turkey to be offered a "privileged partnership" with the EU, rather than full membership at the end of accession negotiations.

According to an opinion prepared at the Cypriot government's request by four prominent international legal scholars - including Oxford's Ian Brownlie and Derrick Wyatt, James Crawford of Cambridge University, and Alain Pellet of the University of Paris (a former chairman of the UN's International Law Commission) - an EU endorsement of Turkey's non-recognition of Cyprus would be a breach by the EU itself of the European Treaty, which states that the union "shall respect the national identity of member states". 
The opinion also states that Turkey's non-recognition of Cyprus calls into question the implementation of the Turkey-EU customs union in the case of Cyprus.

The Greek government reluctantly confronted Turkey's refusal to recognise Cyprus only after French President Jacques Chirac stressed that such recognition should be a precondition for opening accession talks with Turkey. 
But even then, Athens avoided articulating a specific demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus. 
The guarded statement by Greek foreign ministry spokesman George Koumoutsakos was indicative: 
"The Turkish declaration has raised a series of problems that should be addressed by the EU so as not to have an unclear situation."

*Gul provokes Europeans *

In a much-discussed interview with the English-language /Turkish Daily News/, Gul indicated that Ankara is only prepared to recognise the "partnership state" that would be created after an eventual Cyprus settlement, and not the Republic of Cyprus. 
Gul also stated that the opening of Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot vessels is contingent upon the lifting of international trade restrictions on Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.

But the free access of Cypriot vessels to Turkish ports is part and parcel of the extension of Turkey's EU customs union to Cyprus, which EU leaders in December set as a precondition for the opening of accession talks with Ankara. 
"Obviously, the Greek-Cypriots are only after one-sided openings from Turkey and want to turn this issue into a Turkish-EU matter. 
This is not acceptable," Gul insisted.

The European Commission, which rejected French calls for Turkey to recognise Cyprus before starting membership talks, insists that Ankara is obliged to open its ports to Cypriot vessels. Krisztina Nagy, a spokesperson for enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn, told the /AthensNews/ that "it is an obligation under the customs union to ensure the free movement of goods into Turkey, so access to all Cypriot vessels should have been granted already. 
The commission has repeatedly stated this to our Turkish partners and will continue to do so."

Many believe that the recognition of Cyprus is merely being exploited as an obstacle to Turkish EU membership, which faces a groundswell of opposition in many EU countries. 
Germany's Christian Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel, who is considered likely to come to power in the September 18 general elections, wrote to the leaders of all 25 EU member states in late August, asking them to seriously consider granting Turkey a "privileged partnership" status after negotiations, rather than full EU membership.

Talk of such a privileged partnership has elicited outraged reactions from Ankara. "I find such an offer illegitimate and immoral. 
This nullifies our common effort of half a century. 
It also has the potential to handicap the future of our relations," Gul declared.

The German Christian Democrats immediately denounced the tenor of Gul's remarks, which were viewed as unbecoming a candidate country.
