CAIRO (Reuters) - For Mohamed Saeed, 28, Egyptian presidents other than Hosni Mubarak are all figures from distant history. 
Aged four when Mubarak came to power, it's hard for him to imagine an alternative.

While some Egyptians see Mubarak's 24 years in power as justification for change, for others it is a good enough reason alone to vote for him in the country's first presidential election on Wednesday.

"It would be difficult for somebody else. 
He won't understand the people, how things work," said Saeed.

"Where's their experience?" he asked of the nine politicians challenging Mubarak in the elections.

"We know him and he knows us," said Ibrahim Aziz, agreeing with Saeed that challengers including liberal politician Ayman Nour, 40, could not possibly measure up to the 77-year-old Mubarak, who is widely expected to win the election.

Both said they would vote for Mubarak.

"He took power 10 days after I was born," Ahmed Abdel Rabo, 24, said. 
"I'm a good omen for him and he's a good omen for me. 
It's enough that we haven't had a war during his presidency."

Mubarak's decision to allow a multi-candidate presidential election this year surprised Egyptians, who have known only four presidents since the military overthrew the monarchy in 1952.

Mubarak was previously returned to office by uncontested referendums.

The young Egyptians who make up the bulk of the country's 72 million people have no recollection of Mubarak's predecessor Anwar Sadat, let alone Gamal Abdel Nasser. 

Both died in office.

University student Ahmed Yahya said that even with multi-candidate presidential elections, Mubarak's rule would end in the same way as his predecessors.

"Mubarak will remain president of Egypt. 
The only thing that will stop him is death," Yahya, 18, said.

After two automatic successions to vice presidents, in 1970 and again in 1981, followed by 24 years of Mubarak, it is hard for Egyptians to imagine a change at the top through the ballot box, 21-year old student Mohamed el-Araby said.

"The whole idea is new. 
The people are not familiar with it. 
By the next elections it will be better," he said, in reference to the next presidential vote in 2011. 

For Mohamed Hussein, who sells mobile phone covers in the street, the change cannot come soon enough. 
Hussein, 30, wants to leave for Saudi Arabia because he does not make enough money to keep his wife and child. 

"There's no democracy that allows a president to stay in power for 25 years," he said. 
There is no democracy. 
Where are the jobs?"
