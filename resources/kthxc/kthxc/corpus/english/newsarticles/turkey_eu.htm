<B>  Can the European Union absorb Turkey? </B>

*The talk* in Brussels on October 2 and 3 is about whether a negotiating framework drawn up for Turkey to start membership talks is strict enough.

The framework - seventeen pages of conditions and goals - is, in fact, the strictest ever devised for a candidate country. 
Never before has an aspiring EU member been told that theirs is "an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand". 
Nor has anyone been told that if they breach the principles of democracy, liberty, human rights and fundamental freedoms the Commission will "recommend the suspension of negotiations and propose the conditions for eventual resumption".

All this may seem like a slight against a proud nation, yet one EU member continues to block the framework. Austria wants to drop the stated goal of full accession, preferring to aim for a special relationship - something Germany's majority Christian Democrats and France's powerful interior minister, tipped to be the next president, also support.

Failing that, Austria would at least like to strengthen existing language that admits the possibility of failure: 
"If Turkey is not in a position to assume in full all the obligations of membership, it must be ensured that Turkey is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible [alternative] bond"
(the word "alternative" being Austria's desired inclusion).

The EU works on a basis of consensus, and even on the rare occasions when one member pits itself against the rest a formula is usually found to give it satisfaction without derailing the majority position. 
That is what foreign ministers will hope to achieve ahead of the official start of the council meeting on October 3.

The framework will be difficult enough for Turkey to stomach as it stands. 
Privately, Turkish diplomats express doubts that national pride will allow the ruling AKP party to approve it in parliament. 
Be that as it may, this document probably represents the most lenient position Europeans can take for the foreseeable future, given the growing popular opposition to Turkish membership.

Some of those opposed to Turkey's entry are eurosceptics already suspicious of how much power the proposed EU constitution concentrates in the hands of large countries. 
The so-called 'double majority' system would allow thirteen of the EU's 25 members to achieve a qualified majority as long as they represented sixty percent of the Union's population.

Last week French Interior Minister and UMP party leader Nicolas Sarkozy showed how this system could be used by a few large members to lead the Union. France and Germany, the traditional engine of integration, should form an inner core along with Britain, Italy, Spain and Poland, he proposed.

Together, the six nations represent more than 300 million of the EU's 450 million-strong population. 
Along with some traditional acolytes and a little proselytising, they could in theory dominate qualified majority votes.

As a member of the Union, Turkey would certainly demand the same voting rights as its largest member, Germany, whose population it nearly equals. 
For eurosceptics, that would compound the political conundrum of a two-speed Europe controlled by six capitals. It would add a mostly poor, Muslim country into the decision-making core of mostly Christian Europe, introducing both cultural and economic problems. 
Turkey would command enormous Cohesion Fund subsidies, agricultural subsidies and structural funds the Union is presently thinking of scaling back, because it realises that handing out money to its national economies does not necessarily make them more competitive.

Then there remain questions about whether Turkish political culture can stomach a Western concept of rights. 
Only last week a Turkish judge outlawed a conference of academics at Bogazici Universitesi (Bosphorus University) to discuss the Armenian massacres of 1915

The West sees these as amounting to genocide, and Turkey has tried to intimidate resolutions to that effect in the French, German and US legislatures in recent years. 
An exhibition commemorating a 1955 Istanbul pogrom against Greeks, which seems to have enjoyed official tolerance, was attacked by protesters only weeks ago.

Turkish sensitivity over history extends to policymaking today. 
The idea that Turkey's 1974 invasion of northern Cyprus "solved" the island's bicommunal problem is still sacred, even after the fall of Rauf Denktash. 
The result is that Turkey refuses to recognise Cyprus, an EU-member.

As Turkey seeks membership to the EU, it is natural that it will be audited in every way - economically, historically, politically and morally. 
The indications are that Europeans and other Westerners will answer the call for judgement vigorously. 
Last week, the Washington-based group Mental Disability Rights International released a report, timed to appear before the meeting of EU foreign ministers, saying that Turkey uses electroshock therapy as a punishment against mental patients.

It is no secret that the tests on Turkey are more stringent than those on previous EU members, but there is good reason for that. Turkey is a vast potential new addition to a Union that is in crisis. 
It is also culturally far more alien than any previous member, and it will be materially more demanding. 
And Turkey has a very proud view of itself.
It is not applying to the EU with humility. 
It is banging on the door with one foot on an EU member's throat (Cyprus), and not always friendly behaviour towards its only EU neighbour (Greece).

It is right for the Union to maintain full membership as the ultimate goal of talks, because Turkey's exclusion should not be a foregone conculsion. 
But it is also right to point out that Turkey's accession will be a difficult one.
